# Ruby MCP Server Demo

This is a barebones demo of a Ruby Model Context Protocol server that uses the `mcp` gem.

## Running the demo

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
```

2. Start the server:

```bash
bundle exec ruby server.rb
```

The server will start and listen for requests on http://localhost:8081/mcp.
